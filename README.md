# Problem Statement

We would like you to develop a web app that displays these offers to truckers using the provided
design. If ambiguities arise, use your best judgement.

## Specification

Deliver a web app that queries a JSON API from the browser and renders the resulting shipment offers
according to the provided design. The app should allow the user to paginate through offers and sort
them based upon ​pickupDate​(default), ​dropoffDate​ , ​price​, ​origin​, ​destination​, or ​miles​.

● API:​ ​[https://convoy-mock-api.herokuapp.com](https://convoy-mock-api.herokuapp.com)

● Design:​ [​http://bit.ly/fe-hw-design-s3](​http://bit.ly/fe-hw-design-s3)

### Notes

The API is hosted on a limited Heroku account and may periodically fail or take a while to respond.

Use any library or framework of your choosing. We will dedicate some time during your on-site
interviews to discuss your implementation choices, so be mindful of tradeoffs and alternatives.

You are encouraged, but not required, to make adjustments to the design, but be prepared to justify
your decisions to a designer.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
